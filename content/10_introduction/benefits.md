The security of AWS infrastructure and products is designed to meet the needs of the largest and most demanding customers. However, security features that are usually too expensive or impractical for smaller customers, can be provided effectively by AWS to all customers regardless of the size of their organization. 

AWS has teams of solutions architects, technical account managers, consultants, trainers, and other staff trained in cloud security and compliance. They are trained to assist AWS customers to achieve a superior level of security and compliance in the cloud by following cloud security best practices. They assist customers with integrating their existing control frameworks with AWS security controls. 

AWS publishes whitepapers that relate to security, governance and risk and compliance, and several checklists and best practices.

Physical and network security, data privacy, encryption, and inherent security are all built into AWS services at no additional cost to the customer.
