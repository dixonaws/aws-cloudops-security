Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS workloads for vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans Amazon EC2 instances and container images residing in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

When a software vulnerability or network issue is discovered, Amazon Inspector creates a finding. A finding describes the vulnerability, identifies the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance. 

Additional benefits of Amazon Inspector include:

- Automated discovery and continual scanning that delivers near real-time vulnerability findings

- Central management, configuration, and view of findings for all your organizationsâ€™ accounts by setting a Delegated Administrator (DA) account

- A highly contextualized and meaningful Inspector risk score for each finding to help you set more accurate response priorities
