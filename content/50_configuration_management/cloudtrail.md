AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. 

Visibility into your AWS account activity is a key aspect of security and operational best practices. You can use CloudTrail to view, search, download, archive, analyze, and respond to account activity across your AWS infrastructure. You can identify who or what took which action, what resources were acted upon, when the event occurred, and other details to help you analyze and respond to activity in your AWS account. 

AWS Cloudtrail helps you answer the following questions: <br>
- Who made the API call? <br>
- When was the API call made? <br>
- What was the API call?<br>
- Which resources were acted up on in the API call?<br>
- Where was the API call made from and made to?<br>
