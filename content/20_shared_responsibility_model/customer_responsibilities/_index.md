Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as their responsibilities vary depending on the services used, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations. 

For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Customers that deploy an Amazon EC2 instance are responsible for <b> management of the guest operating system </b>(including updates and security patches), any <b> application software </b> or utilities installed by the customer  on the instances, and the <b> configuration of the AWS-provided firewall </b> (called a security group) on each instance. 

For abstracted services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and platforms, and customers access the endpoints to store and retrieve data. Customers are responsible for <b> managing their data </b> (including encryption options), <b> classifying their assets</b> , and <b> using IAM tools </b> to apply the appropriate permissions.
