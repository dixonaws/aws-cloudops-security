The environment of AWS data centers is protected by several security features. 

<b>Fire Detection and Suppression </b>
<p>AWS data centers feature automatic fire detection and suppression equipment to reduce the risk of fire-related accidents. The fire detection system uses smoke detection sensors in all data center environments, mechanical and electrical infrastructure spaces, chiller rooms, and generator equipment rooms. </p>

<b> Power </b>
<p>The data center electrical power systems are fully redundant and maintainable without impact to operations-24 hours a day, seven days a week. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units provide back-up power for critical and essential loads in the facility if an electrical failure occurs. </p>

<b> Climate and Temperature </b>
<p>Climate control is used to maintain a constant operating temperature for servers and other hardware. This prevents overheating and reduces the possibility of service outages, Data centers are conditioned to maintain atmospheric conditions at optimal levels.</p>

<b>Monitoring Equipment</b>
<p>AWS monitors electrical, mechanical, and life support systems and equipment so that issues are immediately identified. Preventative maintenance is performed to enable the continued operability of equipment.</p>

<b>Storage Device Decommissioning</b>

<p>When a storage device has reached the end of its useful life, it is decommissioned using processes that prevent access to the data by unauthorized individuals. AWS uses the techniques detailed in Guidelines for Media Sanitization (NIST 800-88) to destroy data as part of the decommissioning process. </p>
