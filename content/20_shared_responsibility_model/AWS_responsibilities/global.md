The AWS global infrastructure is designed and managed according to security best practices and a variety of security compliance standards.AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all services offered in the AWS cloud. Customers canâ€™t visit AWS data centers or offices to see this protection firsthand.

However, AWS engages with external certifying bodies and independent auditors to provide customers with considerable information regarding the policies, processes, and controls established and operated by AWS. Third party reports help to address compliance requirements. Third party audits validate that controls are implemented and operating effectively.
