AWS data centers are advanced facilities, comprising innovative architectural and engineering approaches. Amazon has many years of experience in designing and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the AWS platform and infrastructure.

Building: 
AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. 

Perimeter and Entry: 
Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at the building ingress points.

Security Staff and Surveillance: 
Professional security staff use video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means.

Two-factor Authentication:
Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication at least twice to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification. AWS only provides data center access and information to employees and contractors who have a legitimate business need for such privileges. 

The access of an employee who no longer has a business need for these privileges, is immediately revoked. This procedure is followed even if the employee remains with Amazon or AWS.

Escort: 
All visitors are signed in and contrinually escorted by authorized staff. All physical access to data centers is routinely logged and audited.
