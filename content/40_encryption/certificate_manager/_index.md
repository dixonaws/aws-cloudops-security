AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) handles the complexity of creating, storing, and renewing public and private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates and keys that protect AWS websites and applications. You can provide certificates for your integrated AWS services either by issuing them directly with ACM or by importing third-party certificates into the ACM management system. 

ACM certificates are deployed through Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and other [integrated AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html). The most common application of this kind is a secure public website with significant traffic requirements.
