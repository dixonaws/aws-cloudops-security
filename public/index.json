By the end of this two-session module, you will be able to perform basic Linux and AWS administration tasks as a preparation for the following AWS Cloud Administrator bootcamp. Depending on your level of experience, you may want to have a look at the Further Reading section to learn more about Linux administration.  We\u0026rsquo;ll have two instructor-led sessions and two \u0026ldquo;office hours\u0026rdquo; sessions. You should expect to get through the basics - Exercises 1 and 2 - during the first session. Exercises 3, 4, and 5 are a bit more challenging. Work through them and bring questions during the instructor-led sessions or office hours sessions.\nYour Tourguides:           John Dixon\nSolutions Architect, AWS\nMünchen, Germany Claudiu Bota\nSolutions Architect, AWS\nMadrid, Spain Tux\nLinux Mascot\nUnknown    "

	"content": "   Linux in the datacenter Linux on IoT devices Linux on planes Linux on phones            From Wikipedia: Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.\nDistributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo; in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.\nPopular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu, CentOS. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.\nLinux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones, Linux also has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. Although it is used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop computers, the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US K–12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US. Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux),leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors).\nLinux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart home technology (like Google Nest), televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs use Tizen and WebOS, respectively), automobiles (for example, Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota all rely on Linux), digital video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches. The Falcon 9\u0026rsquo;s and the Dragon 2\u0026rsquo;s avionics use a customized version of Linux.\nLinux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source code may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License.\n90% of all cloud infrastructure is powered by Linux including supercomputers and cloud providers. 74% of smartphones in the world are Linux-based.\n "

You should see some output similar to the screenshot below. If xvdf is listed with the xfs filesystem, then you have correctly formatted the volume.   The next step is to create a mount point directory for the volume. This mount point is where we will read and write files to the volume:\nsudo mkdir /data    Verification steps   List the directory to make sure you created it in the right place. Issue the following command to list the directory: ls -lah /. You will see a listing of the root directory or filesystem. FYI, \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; is known as the root filesystem, not to be confused with the root user. Make sure that the data directory exists here, indicated in the screenshot above by the entry circled in red. This entry indicates that the data is a directory owned by the root user (and root group) that was created on 19 Feb at 11:52 UTC. The string _drwxr-xr-x indicates that the directory is read-write-execute for the owner, read-execute for the group (root) and read-execute for everyone else. These permissions can be encoded as 755 where the first number (7) corresponds to the owner\u0026rsquo;s permissions, the second (5) corresponds to the group permissions, and the third (5) corresponds to permissions for everyone else. Read permissions are represeted by the number 4, write permissions by the number 2, and execute permissions by the number 1. So, permissions of 7 are equal to read-write-execute (4+2+1). For directories, execute means that a user can enter the directory and list contents.   Finally, we mount the volume at the directory:\nsudo mount /dev/xvdf /data    Verification steps   To verify that the volume is mounted, you can use the mount command without any arguments. The last line in this sample output shows that the device named xvdf is mounted on the data directory.\n[ec2-user@ip-123-45-67-89 ~]$ mount sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime) proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime) devtmpfs on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,nosuid,size=492684k,nr_inodes=123171,mode=755) securityfs on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime) tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev) devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000) tmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,mode=755) tmpfs on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=755) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,xattr,release_agent=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-cgroups-agent,name=systemd) pstore on /sys/fs/pstore type pstore (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls,net_prio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,net_cls,net_prio) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpu,cpuacct) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/pids type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,pids) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/memory type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,memory) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpuset) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,freezer) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hugetlb) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,perf_event) cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/devices type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,devices) /dev/xvda1 on / type xfs (rw,noatime,attr2,inode64,noquota) debugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,relatime) systemd-1 on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=31,pgrp=1,timeout=0,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=12416) mqueue on /dev/mqueue type mqueue (rw,relatime) hugetlbfs on /dev/hugepages type hugetlbfs (rw,relatime,pagesize=2M) sunrpc on /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw,relatime) tmpfs on /run/user/1000 type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=100692k,mode=700,uid=1000,gid=1000) /dev/xvdf on /data type xfs (rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota) [ec2-user@ip-172-31-60-29 ~]$ You could also use the df command to list the currently mounted filesystems (df is the disk free command, and the -h option is for human readable):\n[ec2-user@ip-172-31-60-29 ~]$ df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on devtmpfs 482M 0 482M 0% /dev tmpfs 492M 0 492M 0% /dev/shm tmpfs 492M 420K 492M 1% /run tmpfs 492M 0 492M 0% /sys/fs/cgroup /dev/xvda1 8.0G 1.5G 6.6G 18% / tmpfs 99M 0 99M 0% /run/user/1000 /dev/xvdf 10G 43M 10G 1% /data    At this point, we have created a new EBS volume, formatted it, and mounted it in the Linux instance.

Some critical files (such as /etc/fstab) can prevent the system from booting properly if there are typos or incorrect configuration.\n sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig Next, find the device\u0026rsquo;s 128-bit universally unique identifier (UUID). This UUID, unlike the devices' names, is unique and does not change:\nsudo blkid This command will return the UUID of your devices. Save the UUID of /dev/xvdf.

You\u0026rsquo;ll see that the pricing of instances varies widely. Our t2.micro instance in us-east-1 costs $0.0116/hr \u0026ndash; that is, a little over a penny. Reading further, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that these so-called on-demand instances are actually charged per second. Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage is charged a bit differently than EC2.
